## Wiki NSFW Chrome Extension

### what?
Chrome extension which blurs all images on wikipedia per default.

### why?
This prevents wikipedia from throwing big ass pictures of hitler or some skin desease in your face while you are at work.

### how?
If you want to reveal a picture, click on it. If you leave the picture frame with your mouse, it will be blurred again.

### next?
the blur is slow as a dog, I'd be happy for a pull request or tips to make it faster.

### ok?
No warranty, no support, yadayada
